# üåê `wkls`: Well-Known Locations

`wkls` makes it easy to explore global administrative boundaries ‚Äî from countries to cities ‚Äî using clean, chainable Python syntax. It reads directly from [Overture Maps Foundation](https://overturemaps.org/) GeoParquet data hosted on the AWS Open Data Registry.

You can instantly get geometries in formats like WKT, WKB, HexWKB, GeoJSON, and SVG:

```python
import wkls
print(wkls.us.ca.sanfrancisco.wkt()) # => "MULTIPOLYGON (((-122.9915659 37.7672733...)))"
```

## Installation

```python
pip install wkls
```

> Requires DuckDB with the spatial extension (loaded automatically). The package is self-contained and lightweight.

## Usage

### üîπ Accessing geometry

WKLS supports **up to 3 chained attributes**:
1. **Country** (required) ‚Äì must be a 2-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (e.g. `us`, `de`, `fr`)
2. **Region** (optional) ‚Äì must be a valid region ISO code suffix (e.g. `ca` for `US-CA`, `ny` for `US-NY`)
3. **Place** (optional) ‚Äì a **name** match against subtypes: `county`, `locality`, or `neighborhood`

Examples:
```python
wkls.us.wkt()                          # country: United States
wkls.us.ca.wkt()                       # region: California
wkls.us.ca.sanfrancisco.wkt()          # city/county: San Francisco
wkls["us"]["ca"]["sanfrancisco"].wkt() # dictionary-style access
```

Supported formats:
- `.wkt()` ‚Äì Well-Known Text
- `.wkb()` ‚Äì Raw binary WKB
- `.hexwkb()` ‚Äì Hex-encoded WKB
- `.geojson()` ‚Äì GeoJSON string
- `.svg()` ‚Äì SVG path string

### üîé What does `wkls.us.ca.sanfrancisco` return?

Chained expressions like wkls.us.ca.sanfrancisco return a Wkl object. Internally, this holds a Pandas DataFrame containing one or more rows that match the given chain.

```python
        id           country    region   subtype       name           division_id
0  085718963fffff...   US       US-CA    county    San Francisco  085718963fffff...
```

In most cases, it resolves to a single administrative boundary ‚Äî for example, San Francisco county or locality. But if there are name collisions (e.g., both a county and a locality called ‚ÄúSan Francisco‚Äù), multiple rows may be returned.

By default, geometry methods like `.wkt()` will use the first matching row.

### üß† Helper methods

The following methods return Pandas DataFrames for easy exploration:

| Method                     | Description                        |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `wkls.countries()`         | List all countries                 |
| `wkls.us.regions()`        | List regions in the US             |
| `wkls.us.ca.counties()`    | List counties in California        |
| `wkls.us.ca.cities()`      | List cities in California          |
| `wkls.subtypes()`          | Show all distinct division subtypes |


## How It Works

WKLS works in two stages:

### 1. üß© In-memory GERS ID resolution

Your chained attributes ‚Äî up to 3 levels ‚Äî are parsed in this order:

1. `country` ‚Üí matched by ISO 2-letter code (e.g. `"us"`)
2. `region` ‚Üí matched using region ISO code suffix (e.g. `"ca"` ‚Üí `"US-CA"`)
3. `place` ‚Üí fuzzy-matched against names in subtypes: `county`, `locality`, or `neighborhood`

This resolves to a Pandas DataFrame containing one or more rows from the in-memory wkls metadata table. At this stage, no geometry is loaded yet ‚Äî only metadata (like id, name, region, subtype, etc.).

### 2. üì° Geometry lookup using DuckDB

The geometry lookup is triggered only when you call one of the geometry methods:
- `.wkt()`
- `.wkb()`
- `.hexwkb()`
- `.geojson()`
- `.svg()`

At that point, WKLS uses the previously resolved **GERS ID** to query the Overture **division_area** GeoParquet directly from S3.
